# Comparison of Regression Algorithms

| Feature                  | **Linear Regression**  | **Decision Tree Regression**  | **KNN Regression**  |
|--------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| **Interpretability**      | Highly interpretable ✅ | Moderate (tree structure helps) ✅ | Hard to interpret (instance-based) ❌ |
| **Computational Cost**    | Very fast (O(n)) ✅ | Moderate (O(log n)) ✅ | Slow for large datasets (O(n)) ❌ |
| **Training Speed**        | Very fast ✅ | Fast ✅ | No training phase, but slow at prediction ❌ |
| **Prediction Speed**      | Very fast ✅ | Very fast ✅ | Slow for large datasets ❌ |
| **Works Well for Large Datasets?** | Yes ✅ | Yes ✅ | No, due to high computation cost ❌ |
| **Assumption About Data** | Assumes linear relationship ❌ | No assumptions ✅ | No assumptions ✅ |
| **Flexibility (Non-Linearity)** | Poor (only linear) ❌ | Good (handles complex relationships) ✅ | Excellent (highly non-linear) ✅ |
| **Overfitting Tendency**  | High if relationship is non-linear ❌ | High (but pruning helps) ❌ | High if K is too small ❌ |
| **Feature Scaling Needed?** | No ✅ | No ✅ | Yes (e.g., Min-Max, Standardization) ❌ |
| **Robust to Outliers?**    | No, sensitive to outliers ❌ | Yes, more robust ✅ | No, sensitive to outliers ❌ |
| **Handles Missing Data Well?** | No ❌ | Yes ✅ | No ❌ |
| **Decision Boundary Complexity** | Linear ❌ | Non-linear ✅ | Highly non-linear ✅ |

### **When to Use Each?**
- **Linear Regression**: If the relationship between variables is linear and interpretability is crucial.
- **Decision Tree Regression**: When the relationship is non-linear, interpretability is desired, and quick predictions are needed.
- **KNN Regression**: If you have a small dataset with complex patterns and you want a non-parametric approach.
