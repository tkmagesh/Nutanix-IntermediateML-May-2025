# Decision Trees Vs K-Nearest Neighbors

| Feature            | **Decision Trees**  | **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  |
|-------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|
| **Interpretability** | Easy to understand and visualize ✅ | Hard to interpret, as predictions are based on distance calculations ❌ |
| **Data Type** | Works well with both categorical & numerical data ✅ | Best suited for numerical data ✅ |
| **Computational Cost** | Fast prediction (O(log n)) ✅ | Slow prediction, especially for large datasets (O(n)) ❌ |
| **Training Speed** | Relatively fast ✅ | No training phase (lazy learner), but slow at prediction ❌ |
| **Handling Missing Data** | Can handle missing values well ✅ | Requires imputation ❌ |
| **Handling Outliers** | Robust to outliers ✅ | Sensitive to outliers ❌ |
| **Works Well for Large Datasets?** | Yes ✅ | No, due to high computational cost ❌ |
| **Decision Boundary** | Works well for linear and simple non-linear boundaries ✅ | Works well for highly non-linear decision boundaries ✅ |
| **Sensitivity to Noise** | Prone to overfitting, but pruning helps ❌ | Very sensitive to noise ❌ |
| **Feature Scaling Required?** | No, works without normalization ✅ | Yes, requires normalization (e.g., Min-Max, Standardization) ❌ |
| **Memory Usage** | Low memory usage ✅ | High memory usage (stores entire dataset) ❌ |

### **Summary**
- **Use Decision Trees** if you want a fast, interpretable model that works well with structured data.
- **Use KNN** if you have a small, well-structured dataset and expect complex decision boundaries.
