### **Machine Learning Types**
Machine Learning Types are broadly categorized into different types based on how the model learns from data. Below are the key categories:

---

### **1. Supervised Learning**
- **Definition**: The model is trained on labeled data, meaning it has both input (features) and corresponding output (target).
- **Objective**: Learn a mapping from input to output and make predictions on new data.
- **Types**:
  - **Regression**: Predicts continuous values (e.g., predicting house prices).
  - **Classification**: Predicts discrete categories (e.g., spam vs. non-spam emails).
- **Examples**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Neural Networks

### **2. Unsupervised Learning**
- **Definition**: The model is trained on **unlabeled** data, meaning there is no predefined output.
- **Objective**: Find patterns, groupings, or structures in the data.
- **Types**:
  - **Clustering**: Groups similar data points together (e.g., customer segmentation).
  - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduces the number of features while retaining essential information.
- **Examples**:
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Hierarchical Clustering
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Autoencoders

---

### **3. Semi-Supervised Learning**
- **Definition**: A combination of supervised and unsupervised learning where the model is trained on a small amount of labeled data and a larger set of unlabeled data.
- **Objective**: Improve learning efficiency when labeled data is scarce.
- **Examples**:
  - Self-training models
  - Graph-based learning

---

### **4. Reinforcement Learning**
- **Definition**: The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions.
- **Objective**: Maximize long-term rewards by optimizing decision-making strategies.
- **Key Components**:
  - **Agent**: The decision-maker (e.g., a robot or game player).
  - **Environment**: The space where the agent operates.
  - **Actions**: Choices the agent can make.
  - **Rewards**: Feedback received for good or bad actions.
- **Examples**:
  - Q-Learning
  - Deep Q Networks (DQN)
  - AlphaGo (Google DeepMind)

---

### **5. Self-Supervised Learning**
- **Definition**: A variant of supervised learning where the model generates its own labels from the input data.
- **Objective**: Learn useful representations without relying on manually labeled data.
- **Examples**:
  - Contrastive Learning (e.g., SimCLR, MoCo)
  - Transformers (e.g., BERT for NLP)

---

### **6. Deep Learning**
- **Definition**: A subset of machine learning using artificial neural networks with multiple layers.
- **Objective**: Learn complex patterns in large datasets, often outperforming traditional ML in tasks like image recognition and natural language processing.
- **Examples**:
  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) – used for image processing.
  - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) – used for sequential data like speech.
  - Transformers (e.g., GPT, BERT) – used for NLP.

---

### **Conclusion**
Each technique is used based on the nature of the problem. **Supervised learning** is best for predictive tasks, **unsupervised learning** for finding patterns, **reinforcement learning** for decision-making, and **deep learning** for highly complex data.
