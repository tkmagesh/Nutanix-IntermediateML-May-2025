In the context of **missing data** in statistics and data science, the terms **MCAR**, **MAR**, and **MNAR** refer to different mechanisms of missingness. Understanding these helps decide how to handle missing data appropriately:

---

### 1. **MCAR — Missing Completely At Random**

* **Definition**: The probability of a value being missing is **completely independent** of both **observed and unobserved data**.
* **Implication**: The missing data is like a random sample — there’s no pattern or bias.
* **Example**: A lab technician randomly forgets to record some measurements due to distractions — it's unrelated to the patient or test results.

 **Best-case scenario** — analyses remain unbiased if you ignore or impute this missing data.

### 2. **MAR — Missing At Random**

* **Definition**: The probability of missingness depends only on **observed data**, not on the missing (unobserved) values themselves.
* **Implication**: If we know the observed data, we can model the missingness.
* **Example**: Women are less likely to disclose their income in a survey, but if we know gender, we can model the probability of missing income.

**Assumption-sensitive** — with the right model, this can be adjusted using methods like **multiple imputation** or **maximum likelihood**.

### 3. **MNAR — Missing Not At Random**

* **Definition**: The missingness depends on the **unobserved (missing) data itself**.
* **Implication**: Even if we know all observed data, we **still can’t fully explain** the missingness without modeling the missing values directly.
* **Example**: People with very high incomes are more likely to skip the income question. The fact it's missing *is* because it's high.

**Most problematic** — you need to **explicitly model** the missing data mechanism (e.g., using selection models or sensitivity analysis).
